                        The bower package contains the JavaScript library, CSS as well as the Sass (SCSS) files.
                        You can then integrate the desired dependencies in your project and start using them
                        immediately.

                        The quickest way to get things up and running is by using the Chartist.js CSS files.
                        The CSS is compiled from the Sass files with the default class names which are also
                        configured in the JavaScript library. You can then override the default styles or
                        modify the CSS file, however, for customization it's recommended to use the Sass
                        version of Chartist.js.

                        If you'd like to get started even faster you can also use a CDN to load Chartist.js. The

                        around the world! They always update Chartist.js to the latest version immediately and

                        If you like to customize your charts you can either remove the CSS fully and write your
                        own selectors using the Chartist.js Sass mixins or you just use the Chartist.js Sass
                        settings file to customize the look and feel of your charts.

                        Styling inline SVG with CSS is a breeze and you should also consider writing your own
                        selectors for your charts and using the Sass mixins. You can read more about using the
                        Sass mixins in the <a href="#advanced">advanced</a> section.

                        To customize the style of your charts using the Sass settings file you should copy the
                        settings file to your own Sass folder.

                        Then just import your copy of the settings file before you import the chartist.scss
                        file and change the settings in your copy as desired.

                        own charts. If you want to override certain settings based on state or pseeudo
                        selectors, you can use the individual mixins to only override specific styles.

                  In this section you'll go through a simple example of how to use Chartist.js in your project.

                        Chartist provides you a very simple API to get started, however, while trying to follow the
                         best practice of relying on standards and clear separation of concerns it sometimes needs a small mind
                         shift in order to understand how things are meant to work within Chartist. Instead of specifying
                         your colors, line width and other style related things in the JavaScript API, you'll need to use
                         CSS in order to control your appearance.

                              Because of the nature of responsive design it's important to understand that blocks in design like images,
                              videos and similar content need to be able to scale and adapt to the media. In order for an element to scale, you
                              need to rely on a certain aspect ratios (like 4:3, 3:2, 16:9 etc.) rather than specifying a fixed width and height.

                  - type: text
                    data:
                      text: >
                              To designers this Idea is absolutely not new, but to developers this might be at first. However, when a designer talks
                              to a developer about the images being 320x240 on this page and 300x200 on that element, he actually just
                              translated his idea of using 4:3 and 3:2 images into pixels.

                      text: >
                              With Chartist you can specify those ratios directly on containers without the need to calculate any fixed dimensions.
                              In order to create a chart that is using the aspect ratio of a golden section you can just add the class .ct-golden-section
                              to your container where you initialize Chartist.

                  - type: text

                      text: >
                              Here is a list of all available container ratios (If using the Sass version of Chartist you can also easily add others):

                              Give the container the class ct-chart so that it will get the default styles (if you don't

                        as you are probably already aware. Media queries are great and they help you to define media related
                        conditions that you can use to apply different styles for different media.

                        Sometimes it's also required to have different behavior on certain media and it's possible that
                        a specific component of your web site should behave in an other way on a small media than on a
                        large one. Luckily there is window.matchMedia in your browser that comes to the rescue. With
                        matchMedia it's possible to let your javascript react differently based on CSS3 media queries.

                        Configuring different chart behavior for various media is made simple with an override
                        mechanism. The priority of the override mechanism is based on order of specification of
                        the matching media queries.

                        The following example uses different label interpolations (to save some space) on small media
                        as well as different spacing between the bars of the bar chart series. Resize your browser window
                        to see the effect.

              data:
                id: example-simple-bar
                classes: ct-golden-section
                type: Bar
                show-code-button: Show code and comments

                        For IE9 you need to use a matchMedia polyfill. You should take a look at
                        <a href="https://github.com/paulirish/matchMedia.js/">Paul Irish's matchMedia polyfill</a>.

                  In the following chapter you'll find some advanced usage examples that might be of interesst for you.
                  Chartist is very flexible because it relies on standard technology. This also means that you will need
                  to implement certain things yourself. This topic should cover some of these use-cases and give you some
                  basic idea why and how to implement certain functionality.

                        This example shows you how you can easily build a tool tip on top of Chartist using jQuery and some
                        basic styling. It makes use of the ct-series-name and ct-value custom attributes that are present
                        on all SVG elements generated by Chartist.

                text: >
                        We actually do a few things here that would go against a proper style guide (like animating with
                        JavaScript and changing styles instead of switching classes etc.), but this example is only for
                        illustrating how easy behavior could be attached to Chartist.

            - type: example-chart
              data:
                id: behavior-with-jquery
                classes: ct-golden-section
                show-code-button: Show code

                        Usually we recommend using CSS for animations as it's closer to a clean separation of concerns.
                        However, sometimes you would want to animate SVG properties that are not available in CSS to animate.
                        For this purpose we have added a simple but powerful animation API that allows you to create SMIL
                        animations in a more convenient way.

              data:
                text: >
                        In combination with the draw events of Chartist the animations are a very powerful and
                        flexible tool. You can intercept almost any step in chartist and if there is an SVG element
                        involved you can animate it using
                        <a href="api-documentation.html#chartistsvg-function-animate">Chartist.Svg.animate</a>.

                        The following simple example shows you how to created a delayed fade in effect for the a scatter chart.
                        You can also edit the example to play around with the settings.

                         Edit this example to figure out how to tweak animations. The force is strong in you young padawan!
