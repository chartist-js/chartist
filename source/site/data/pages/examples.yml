                   This advanced example uses a line chart to draw a scatter diagram. The data object is created
                   with a functional style random mechanism. There is a mobile first responsive configuration using
                   the responsive options to show less labels on small screens.

          intro: >
                   Adding behavior to your chart with JavaScript is a breeze and is just like any other DOM manipulation
                   you do to your site. This is just one of many benefits of using inline-SVG and provides you with the
                   freedom you need in order to create exactly the experience you're looking for.

          intro: >
                   This chart uses the showArea option to draw line, dots but also an area shape. Use the low option to
                   specify a fixed lower bound that will make the area expand. You can also use the areaBase property
                   to specify a data value that will be used to determine the area shap base position (this is 0 by default).

          classes: ct-golden-section
          intro: >
                   You can also only draw the area shapes of the line chart. Area shapes will always be constructed around
                   their areaBase (that can be configured in the options) which also allows you to draw nice bi-polar
                   areas.

          intro: >
                   Chartist has fixed graphical representations that are chosen because of their flexibility and to
                   provide a high level of separation of the concerns. However, sometimes you probably would like to use
                   different shapes or even images for your charts. One way to achieve this is by using the draw events and replace
                   or add custom SVG shapes.

          intro: >
                    A bi-plar bar chart with a range limit set with low and high. There is also an interpolation
                    function used to skip every odd grid line / label.

          classes: ct-golden-section
          intro: >
                    This example makes use of label interpolation and the seriesBarDistance property that allows you
                    to make bars overlap over each other. This then can be used to use the avialable space on mobile better.

                    With the help of draw events we are able to add a custom SVG shape to the peek of our bars.

          intro: >
                    This pie chart is configured with custom labels specified in the data object. On desktop we use the labelOffset
                    property to offset the labels from the center. Also labelDirection can be used to control the direction
                    in which the labels are expanding.
