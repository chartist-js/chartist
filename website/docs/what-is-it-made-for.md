# What is it made for?

Chartist's goal is to provide a simple, lightweight and unintrusive library to responsively craft charts on your website. 
It's important to understand that one of the main intentions of Chartist is to rely on standards rather than providing 
it's own solution to a problem which is already solved by those standards. We need to leverage the power of browsers 
today and say good bye to the idea of solving all problems ourselves.

Chartist works with inline-SVG and therefore leverages the power of the DOM to provide parts of its functionality. This 
also means that Chartist does not provide it's own event handling, labels, behaviors or anything else that can just be 
done with plain HTML, JavaScript and CSS. The single and only responsibility of Chartist is to help you drawing "Simple 
responsive Charts" using inline-SVG in the DOM, CSS to style and JavaScript to provide an API for configuring your charts.
